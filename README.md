# Geographic crosswalk files

## State FIPS
[State FIPS folder](https://github.com/leima0521/geo_crosswalk/tree/master/state_fips) includes crosswalk files for state name, state abbreviation, and state FIPS code in .dta and .csv format.
R users can use `library(maps)` to get the file directly from `data(state.fips)`.
